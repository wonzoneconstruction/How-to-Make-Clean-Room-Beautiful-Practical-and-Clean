Clean Room, also known as dust-free workshop, dust-free room. Clean room industry is a leading service industry in the development of modern science and technology. The development of modern science and technology not only depends on the development of related clean technology, but also puts forward new technical requirements for clean technology. At present, the whole world is on the eve of industrial transformation, and various emerging technologies are emerging and widely used in the market. This trend not only enlarges the market space of clean rooms, but also directly leads to innovative development in the field of clean room technology.

In the process of design and construction of clean rooms, some enterprises have no way to start in order to make the whole purification project beautiful, practical and clean. Following are the main points summarized by the Engineer of WONZONE Company for your reference.

1. Clean room walls and roofs are usually made of 50 mm thickÂ <a href="http://www.wonzonecn.com/products/cleanroom-room-sandwich-panel/"/>clean room sandwich panel</a>, which is characterized by beautiful appearance, strong rigidity, good thermal insulation performance and easy construction. Arc corner, doors, window frames, etc. are generally made of special alumina profiles.

2. The air supply and return pipeline is made of hot-dip zinc sheet, and flame-retardant PF foamed plastic sheet with good purification and thermal insulation effect needs to be affixed.

3. Stainless steel frame is used for efficient air supply, because it is beautiful and clean. In addition, the aluminium baking varnish used for perforated mesh boards is due to its non-rusting, non-sticky dust and easy cleaning.

4. The floor can be made of epoxy self-flow floor or high-grade wear-resistant plastic floor. If there is anti-static requirement, anti-static type can be chosen.

Focus on clean rooms, dust-free workshops, clean and dust-free workshops, food aseptic workshops, clean engineering.
